# Make Float Great Again
Re-add float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).

In the air, pressing down + jump will allow you to float directly, without needing to perform a double jump first.

Also supports diagonal down + jump to trigger float, default is disabled. (can be enabled by editing the config file `BepinEx\config\com.demojameson.makefloatgreatagain.cfg`)

## To install

### Thunderstore
It should all be handled for you auto-magically.

### Manual
First install BepInEx to your Silksong folder,
(note: this will break how thunderstore does things)

You can find it at
https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
latest stable is currently 5.4.23.4

After unzipping, run the game once, so that the BepInEx folder structure generates
(ie: there's folders in there apart from just `core`)

Then pull this DLL, or folder including the dll in to
`Hollow Knight Silksong\BepInEx\plugins`
